    <h2>üßë‚ÄçüíªWhy node buddies</h2>
    <p>You're not just a user you're part of something real. NodeBuddies was created for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Solo developers</strong> reflecting on their journey the highs, lows, and everything between.</li>
    <li><strong>Burnt-out coders</strong> who just need to breathe, vent, or step away from the pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Junior devs</strong> hungry for advice, encouragement, or a word of mentorship.</li>
    <li><strong>Lonely learners</strong> who need to hear: "You‚Äôre not alone" and maybe find a real friend.</li>
    <li><strong>Experienced developers</strong> who want to give back, share stories, or just connect like real people.</li>
    <li><strong>Devs beyond code</strong>, folks who want to talk about music, burnout, relationships, mental health, or life goals.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
    Whether you‚Äôre building your first app, recovering from burnout, or just want someone to talk to ‚Äî <strong>NodeBuddies is your space.</strong> It‚Äôs about connection, not performance. Real talk, real people.
